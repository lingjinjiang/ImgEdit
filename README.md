# ImgEdit

The image editor is a project I create when I'm a student. Now I refactor it on linux.

At this moment, I can only build it with code::blocks because I'm not familiar with gcc and makefile. So if you want to build it, these are required.

* wxWidget (3.x)
* wxSmith
* code::blocks

Now I'm a java programer, creating this project is just to backup. Maybe someday, I'll upgrade it.
